# vue-seo-friendly-spa-template
Vue.js PWA/SPA template configured for SEO

## General Overview
This template mimics the setup I went through when experimenting with the creation of my own static front-end blog site that was to be hosted on Netlify (using GitHub as a repository/pipeline). You can find that experiment live here: https://basedghostdevelopment.com. After playing around with this process & technologies I figured I'd build a higher-level (yet still feature-rich) abstraction of that project for quick re-use in the future.
