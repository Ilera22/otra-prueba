## General Overview
This template mimics the setup I went through when experimenting with the creation of my own static front-end blog site that was to be hosted on Netlify (using GitHub as a repository/pipeline). You can find that experiment live here: [BasedGhostDevelopment.com](https://www.basedghostdevelopment.com/). After playing around with this process & technologies I figured I'd build a higher-level (yet still feature-rich) abstraction of that project for quick re-use in the future.
